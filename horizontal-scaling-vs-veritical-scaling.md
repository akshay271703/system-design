# Veritical Scaling / Scale Up

Vertical scaling means the process of adding more compute power to your server machine. 

Drawbacks of vertical scaling
- Impossible to add unlimited compute power
- Single point of failure exists

# Horizontal Scaling / Scale Out

Horizontal Scaling means to add more servers to the available resource pool.

Single point of failure - If one resource (reference to server here) goes down, whole application goes down.
